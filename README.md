# Network Synchrony
This repository houses all the code for network synchrony analysis in intermittent streams.

This repository contains end-to-end R workflow to:
  1. standardize and clean binary flow presence/absense data and merge with continuous discharge
  2. calculate three different synchrony metrics among binary flow presence data
  3. relate binary flow to changes in downstream discharge
